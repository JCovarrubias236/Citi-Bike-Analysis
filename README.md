# New York Citi Bike Analysis
In this Tableau challenge I am playing the role of a lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program. I am responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. I will be generating rports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. I have created visualizations for two dashboards and a storyboard.

## NY Citi Bike User Type Analysis
For the dataset that I grabbed from the Citi Bike website, there were a total of 1,156,795 bike ride users. In the top left pie chart, I show the breakdown of the Citi Bike members vs the one time rides. It looks like from January of 2023 to March of 2024, about three quarters of the riders were members!

Moving on to the seasonality trends seen by members and one time riders, we can see that the total number of rides peaked August of 2023 for members and July for one time riders. Based on this, we can see the summer months tend to be more popular for bike riders and on the other hand, winter months see the least amount of riders.

Looking at the average trip duration by month visual, something interesting happens. What we would have thought that would happen is the opposite. Instead, we see that one time riders trips in every month are, on average, longer than of Citi Bike members. A reason for this may be because our members must take bike rides commuting to and from work everyday or if they live further away, they would drive their cars. One reason the one time riders take longer trips must be because they are tourists and riding around the city sight-seeing.

In our last visual on this dashboard, the average trip distance by month line chart, we see something that confirms our explanations for the previous visual. The one time rider trips are, on average, riding further distances than or members.

## Most Utilized Start and Stop Stations
On this dashboard, the purpose is to examine the most popular start and ending stations. The most popular start stations by total trips are Grove St Path, Hoboken Terminal, and South Waterfront Walkway. On the other hand, the most popular trip ending stations are Grove St Path, Hoboken Terminal, South Waterfront Walkway. They are the same for each category.

In the next visualization, I wanted to analyze the combination of start and end station. We can see a few red zones that indicate the most utilized starting and ending stations. This should be a big indicator for which bikes and stations that would need the most maintenance or attention.

Lastly, I wanted to see if the same start/end station combination had the least distance because I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the stations in the previous visual and the distance. As you can see on the red boxes, the most utilized stations are not in the visual, telling us that they are used for longer distance trips.

## Station's Popularity Changes Over Time (Month and Year)
On this map, we can see that from the beginning of 2023, the number of trips by station are small. Then as time passes and summer nears, the amount of trips significantly increase. Then again, as the next year approaches and the weather gets colder, the number of trips decreases. The stations with the most trips are seen along the river and the lesss utilized stations are further inland.
